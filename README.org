* dvp-eu

  Just another variant of the dvorak layout, made for programmers that
  need also to type in non-english languages (mainly Italian and maybe
  other European languages.)

** Goals

   Build a decent, balanced layout and made it configurable through
   provided patches.

** Current status

   I've been using this for some years now, and for a very long time
   without modifying it, so I think I can consider it finished.

   There may still be improvements to made, and I would like to
   include a =patch= directory in the future with some "popular"
   variant.

** Usage

   Just put the =dvp-eu= file in some decent place, like
   =/usr/X11R6/share/X11/xkb/symbols/= on OpenBSD, the load it with
   =setxkbmap=.  In my =.xsession= I have:

   #+begin_src sh
     setxkbmap dvorak -option # remove all options
     setxkbmap dvp-eu -option lv3:ralt_switch -option ctrl:swapcaps
   #+end_src

** Preview

   #+CAPTION: The keyboard (caps lock and control aren't switched by the layout)
   #+NAME: fig:preview
   [[./preview.png]]

   The preview was generated with:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   setxkbmap dvp-eu -print | xkbcomp - - | xkbprint - - > dvp-eu.ps
   #+END_SRC
