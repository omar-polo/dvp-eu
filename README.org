* dvp-eu

  Just another variant of the dvorak layout, made for programmers that
  need also to type in non-english languages.

** Goals

   Build a decent, balanced layout and made it configurable through
   provided patches.

** Current status

   This project is in its early stage of development. I'm still
   looking for some ideas and feedback so the placement of some keys
   may change, until a stable release.

** Usage

   Just put the =dvp-eu= file in some decent place, like
   =/usr/X11R6/share/X11/xkb/symbols/= on OpenBSD, and =loadkeys
   dvp-eu=. Than you're done!

** Preview

   Given that, as of now, the layout is still not definitive, I'm not
   providing any preview of the placement. I'll provide one when it
   will be finished. As of now, you can get a preview of the keyboard
   with

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   setxkbmap dvp-eu -print | xkbcomp - - | xkbprint - - | ps2pdf -pict all - > dvp-eu.pdf
   #+END_SRC
